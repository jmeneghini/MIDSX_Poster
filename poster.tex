  \begin{block}{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is crucial in medical diagnostics but involves risks from ionizing radiation.
      \item Monitoring of radiation exposure is essential, measured in absorbed dose and air kerma \cite{lauer2009elements}.
      \item Monte Carlo (MC) methods allow for precise radiation exposure estimation through accurate photon interaction simulations \cite{essmedphys2012}.
      \item This poster introduces MIDSX, an open-source MC photon transport code system optimized for x-ray transport in medical imaging.
      \item MIDSX's focused design reduces the complexity of implementation and has been validated against established
      benchmarks.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Simulation Geometry}
    The geometry of a transport simulation consists of the following objects:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A source object to specify the generation of photons.
      \item Voxel grid(s), stored via NifTI files \cite{nifti2004}, to contain object/body geometries and material information.
      \item Tally(s) to track trajectories of photons, incident energy, deposited energy, and other quantities of interest.
      \item A computational domain to contain these objects and to specify a background material.
    \end{itemize}

  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Transport Theory}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item As a photon take "steps" through a homogenous computational domain, its position after taking the $n$-th step is represented by the parametric ray equation:
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:r_n}
        \va{r}_{\bm{n}} = \va{r}_{\bm{n-1}} + \vu{d}t,
    \end{equation}
    where $\va{r}_{\bm{n-1}}$ is the position before the $n$-th step, $\vu{d}$ is a unit vector in the direction of the step, and $t$ is the length of the $n$-th step.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For a photon of energy $E$ in material $M$, MIDSX randomly samples $t$ for use in Eq.~\ref{eq:r_n} from the following probability distribution function (PDF):
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:pdf}
      p(t) = n\sigma \exp\left[-t(n\sigma)\right],
    \end{equation}
    where $n$ is the number density of $M$ and $\sigma = \sigma(E, M)$ is the microscopic cross-section of $M$ at $E$.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Using the inversion method for sampling a PDF on Eq.~\ref{eq:pdf}, random values of $t$ can be generated from
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:t_inv}
      t = -\frac{1}{n\sigma} \ln \gamma, 
    \end{equation}
    where $\gamma$ is a uniformly distributed random number in the interval $[0, 1)$.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item In order to generalize this to an inhomogeneous domain, MIDSX uses $\delta$ tracking \cite{vassiliev_monte_2017}.
      \item This effectively changes $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma_{\rm{max}}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:pdf} and Eq.~\ref{eq:t_inv}, where $\sigma_{\rm{max}}$ is the maximum cross-section in the domain.
      \item In order to correct for the resulting systematic decrease in $t$, we implement $\delta$ interactions as an alternative to photon-matter interactions. The probability of which is given by 
    \end{itemize}  

  \end{block}
\end{column}

\separatorcolumn

\begin{column}{\colwidth}

  \begin{equation}
    P_{\delta} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{max}}(E) - \sigma(E, M)}{\sigma_{\text{max}}(E)}.
  \end{equation}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item When a $\delta$ interaction occurs, nothing happens, and the next step is taken.
  \end{itemize}  


  \begin{block}{Photon-Matter Interactions}
    If a $\delta$ interaction does not occur, then a real interaction is sampled. There are 3 fundamental possible photon-matter (real) interactions in the medical x-ray energy range that MIDSX implements:

    \textbf{Implementation}
  \end{center}

  For coherent and incoherent scattering, the methodology of \cite{lund2018implementation} was adapted for use in MIDSX, neglecting Doppler energy broadening and the production of secondary particles. For the photoelectric effect, the photon is terminated and all energy is deposited at the location of interaction.

  \begin{block}{Validation}

    To validate the accuracy of MIDSX, simulations were performed and compared to reference data (PENELOPE, EGSrnc, Geant4, and MCNP) obtained by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group Report 195 (TG-195) \cite{sechopoulos_monte_2015}. Validation was performed for Cases 1, 2, and 5, as described by TG-195.

  \begin{block}{Discussion}
    \section*{Discussion Highlights}

  \begin{itemize}
      \item MIDSX demonstrates varied but reasonable agreement with TG-195 reference code systems, with excellent agreement in Case 1, validating its reliability for primary particle measurements.
      \item Fig.~\ref{fig:ROIPGraph} shows almost universal agreement in ROIs for Case 2, except for discrepancies in incoherent scatter energy deposition in ROIs 4 and 5.
      \item A mean-percent-error (MPE) of 13.1\% for ROI 5 points at numerical instability in the incoherent scattering algorithm, likely due to narrow-angle scatters and the scattering angle distribution at $\theta = 0^\circ$ being steep.
      \item The $15^\circ$ full-field tissue energy deposition of Fig.~\ref{fig:BDGraph} shows an MPE of 0.6\%, indicating possible geometric errors with the source or body.
      \item For Case 5, all organ energy depositions were lower than reference codes, except for the thyroid. The max MPE observed was 6.3\%.
      \item Orientation verification through root-mean-square-percent-error (RMSPE) analysis suggests correct phantom orientation in CT simulations, pointing to other errors in MIDSX that require further investigation.
      \item Future work will focus on investigating the implementation of scattering events, cross-section data initialization, and interpolation errors in MIDSX.
      \item MIDSX source code and usage examples are available in its GitHub repository \cite{MIDSX2023}.
